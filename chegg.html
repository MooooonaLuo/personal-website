                        <h2 id="subtitle2">Design process</h2>
                        <p>My capstone project lasted for 8 weeks. Because I started on this project earlier than other team members, I led the team off by hosting meetings, proposing more reasonable project timelines, and proactively reaching out to the adjacent project team to handle cross-team dependency. Here's what the design process roughly looks like.</p>

                        <h2 id="subtitle2">challenges I overcame</h2>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b id="toogether-highlight">My team was double the size of a normal team, and communication in such a big team was challenging.</b></p>
                        <p>I worked cross-functionally with four interns, each has a manager. The interns took ownership of the project, but I still needed to review my work with the managers. Besides, there were many stakeholders who are less involved but needed to be kept in the loop. I was clueless about how to handle this situation at first, but over time, I developed the skill to <b id="toogether-highlight">communicate with the right person at the right cadence</b>. I also employed <b id="toogether-highlight">different ways to share updates</b> on my design and collect feedback. For example, when I had difficulty scheduling a meeting with our managers, I shared a 5-minute video walkthrough of my design and posted recaps on Slack. This chart shows how I communicated with different skateholders.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b id="toogether-highlight">Another challenge was to collect and synthesize feedback from 20+ people with different levels of involvement in the project.</b></p>
                        <p>I proactively seek feedback from designers in the broader teams' meetings and people in other roles. I found it tricky at the beginning because first, I didn't have enough time to cover everything, and second, people had different levels of knowledge about my project. </p> 
                        <img src="image/chegg_feedback.jpg" alt="Collecting feedback from" width="100%">
                        <p>How did I efficiently collect feedback from a large group of people? <b id="toogether-highlight">I started by introducing the context and emphasizing what feedback I was looking for specifically</b>; instead of covering everything I designed, <b id="toogether-highlight">I focused on one or two parts that mattered the most.</b> </p>
                        <p>As I got more feedback, some appeared to contradict each other. I realized that declining a piece of feedback was indeed harder than taking one. To better handle feedback, I <b id="toogether-highlight">kept the high-level project goal in mind and focused on feedback that was within the scope and important to the goal</b>. I also explained my decision making process, so that people would know their opinions were considered.</p>

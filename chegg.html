                                    <p>The past summer, I interned as a UX designer at Chegg's Engagement UX team. I took ownership of the two projects I worked on. In my capstone project, I worked in a cross-functional team to improve the discoverability and engagement of Chegg's Course Dashboard. Although I'm not able to share any design details at this moment due to the NDA, I'll talk about the design process, challenges, and what I've learned.</p>

                        <h2 id="subtitle2">FROM SKETCHES TO FINAL SOLUTIONS</h2>
                        <p>The project lasted for 8 weeks. Because I started on this project earlier than other team members, I led the team off by proposing more reasonable project timelines, hosting meetings, and proactively reaching out to the other team to handle cross-team dependency. Here's a chart of what the design process roughly looks like.</p>

                        <p id="section-title">REFLECTION</p>
                        <h2 id="subtitle2">CHALLENGES I OVERCAME</h2>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b id="toogether-highlight">My team was double the size of a normal team, and communication in such a big team was challenging.</b></p>
                        <p>I worked cross-functionally with four interns, each has a manager. The interns took ownership of the project, but I still needed to get feedback from the managers. Besides, there were many stakeholders who are less involved but needed to be kept in the loop. I was clueless about how to handle this situation at first, but over time, I developed the skill to communicate with the right person at the right cadence. I also employed different ways to share updates on my design and collect feedback. For example, when I had difficulty scheduling a meeting with our managers, I shared a 5-minute video walkthrough of my design and posted recaps on Slack. This chart shows how I communicated with different skateholders.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b id="toogether-highlight">Another challenge was to collect and synthesize feedback from people not directly involved in my project.</b></p>
                        <p>I proactively seek feedback from designers in the broader teams' meetings and people in other roles. I found it tricky at the beginning because first, I didn't have enough time to cover everything, and second, people had different levels of knowledge about my project. How did I efficiently collect feedback from a large group of people? I started by introducing the context and emphasizing what feedback I was looking for specifically; instead of covering everything I designed, I focused on one or two parts that mattered the most. </p>
                        <p>As I got more feedback, some appeared to contradict each other. I realized that declining a piece of feedback was indeed harder than taking one. To better handle feedback, I kept the high-level project goal in mind and respectfully declined feedback that was out of scope or less important to the goal.</p>

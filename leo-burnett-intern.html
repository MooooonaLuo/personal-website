                                    <p>In summar of 2018, I was glad to join the Audi Creative Team of Leo Burnett Beijing Communications Co., LTd., as a visual design intern.

                        <p>I learned a lot about branding strategies and visual design skills. At first, I was shocked by the high cost of advertisements at first â€” even a single photo could cost million RMB. During the internship, I gradually recognized the power of advertisements. Successful advertisements are vital in building strong brand identities and creating unbreakable emotional bridge between brands and people. A brand that eventually stands out from thousands of competitors is the one that people are mentally connected with.</p>
                        <p>I learned and practiced visual design skills with Adobe Photoshop from my experienced co-worker everyday. With sophisticated skills and abundant experience in visual design, they were able to create a delicate poster design within a couple hours. I understand that to achieve their level, it takes years and years of efforts. Motivated by a desire to turn concepts into reality, I have developed a hobby to learn from excellent design works and practice visual design everyday.</p>

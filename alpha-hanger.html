                    <div class="block">
                        <h2 id="subtitle2">CHARACTERISTICS & STYLES</h2>
                        <p>Together with my client, we identified five brand characteristics: <span style="color: #EE4949; font-weight: bold;">trustworthy, friendly, vigorous, high-quality, and large-scale </span>. Based on the characteristics and existing branding, I determined the colors and fonts for the website. I extracted the primary and secondary colors from the company's logo and slightly altered the hue and saturation. I chose Montserrat for titles since this font family delivers a sense of being reliable and professional.</p>

                        <h2 id="subtitle2">MOOD BOARD & IMAGE STYLE GUIDES</h2>
                        <p>The photo collage serves as a guide for image selection on the website. It demonstrates the moods delivered by images, image content, and image quality. </p>
                        <img src="image/alphahanger_moodboard.jpg" alt="style guide" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 3vh;">
                        <p>There is always a gap between expectation and reality. When discussing this part with my client, they informed me that they could not provide me with high-quality images due to a lack of professional devices and photographers. To overcome this issue, I guided the factory workers in Cambodia to shoot the best photos with what they had. I suggested they use the latest version of the iPhone and wrote detailed instructions on photography composition. The result turned out to be satisfactory. </p>

                    <div class="block">
                        <h2 id="subtitle2">WIREFRAME</h2>
                        <p>I presented my client with a wireframe to collect feedback on website structure, information hierarchy, and navigation.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h2 id="subtitle2">HOMEPAGE DESIGN</h2>
                        <p>The homepage is crucial in delivering the right messages to users at the first glimpse. I proposed three homepage designs to my client. I personally preferred the first two options, but unexpectedly, my client considered the last one the best. To better understand their thoughts, I asked them to list the pros and cons of each design. I later realized that they have a logic behind their choice that I did not discover earlier. There are three things they cared about the most: <span style="color: #EE4949; font-weight: bold;">displaying the images of their factory and products, having a unique style, and being perceived as reliable and professional.</span> Based on the synthesis, I designed an optimized version that met their needs and was eventually adopted.

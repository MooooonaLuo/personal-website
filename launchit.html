                        <p>I worked with my fellow designer to interview 6 college students with different academic backgrounds, asking about their decision-making process when seeking projects to join or recruiting people for their projects.

                        <p>To further understand the gap between users' goals and our initial design, we decided to conduct usability tests. We set up three research goals:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the user flow intuitive? </li>

                        <p>We conducted the usability tests with 6 users and acquired many valuable findings. With a solid base of usability tests, we became confident to create more significant changes in our design, such as navigation, information architecture, and key functions. We developed an affinity diagram to synthesize what we heard and observed during usability tests and devised corresponding solutions.</p>

                        <p>We could make many changes based on the findings, but we didn't have enough capacity to implement them all. We prioritized tasks using the effort vs. impact matrix and applied a spreadsheet to keep track of the progress of design and development teams. </p>

                        <p>There are two navigation bars in the original version, one on the top and one on the left. We found that having two navigation bars distracted users during the usability tests, so we decided to put all navigation components on one side bar. We designed at least 5 versions of navigation bars and conducted mini usability tests to find out which one is the most intuitive. I realized that users’ conceptual models on navigation are very different from mine since many users favored the version that I didn’t think would work at first.</p>

They can modify their application status and contact them via email. Click on a title in the first row, and the system will reorder the list based on that title.</p>

                        <p>I created a very detailed style guide to ensure style consistency throughout all pages and for maintenance. It specifies the use of colors in different conditions and includes components that are used frequently .</p>

                        <p>My main takeaway from this project is the strategy of efficiently collaborating with computer engineers during product development. I used to deliver my design to front-end developers only until I finished a complete cycle of user interviews, usability tests, and prototypes. In this way, the team did not use time wisely, and developers quickly lost patience while waiting for my design. In contrast, developing LaunchIt was considerably efficient, as we streamlined the process through frequent and concise communication between designers and developers. One of the crucial things I did every week was working with the PM to create a task priority list for product development. The list vastly enhanced collaboration efficiency between the design and developing team by coordinating the two teams' schedules.</p>

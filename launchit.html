                                    <p>LaunchIt is a web-based idea incubator for college students. It connects students from various academic backgrounds, empowering them to achieve something bigger together. Many students are eager to make real-world changes with what they have learned from class but have trouble finding projects or teammates. On LaunchIt, through a streamlined experience, project leaders can post their ideas and recruit teammates; students who wish to build something impactful via collaboration can easily find projects of all kinds.</p>

                        <p>At the time I joined the team, they had developed the first version of LaunchIt and decided to shift the focus from lab opportunities to student projects. To adapt the product for this shift, I planned to interview target users to understand their unmet needs and to conducted usability tests to identify flaws and opportunities in the user experience. Below is the original user interface.</p>

                        <h2 id="subtitle2">USER INTERVIEW</h2>
                        <p>I worked with my fellow designer to interview 6 college students with different academic backgrounds, asking about their decision-making process when seeking projects to join or recruiting people for their projects. At the end of the interviews, we also asked them to play around with LaunchIt and provide some feedback so that we could start with minor design changes.</p>
                        <p>Through the interviews, we found out that users care a lot about the details of projects/positions on posts and other users’ profiles. We need a way to guide users to fill out more useful information that other users desire to see. Below are our solutions.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Our product is targeted at two groups of users, students seeking projects to join and project leaders who hope to grow their teams through recruitment. We synthesized our findings in interviews and came up with two user personas.</p>

                        <h2 id="subtitle2">USABILITY TEST</h2>
                        <p>We found 6 people to participate in our usability tests. We assigned them several tasks to go through key features of our design and asked about their experience later on. We acquired plenty of valuable findings. With a solid base of the usability tests, we became confident to create more significant changes in our design, such as navigation, information architecture, and key functions. We developed an affinity diagram to synthesize what we heard and observed during usability tests and came up with corresponding solutions and plans for another round of tests.</p>

                        <p>There are two navigation bars in the original version, one on the top and one on the left. We found that having two navigation bars distracted users during the usability tests, so we decided to put all navigation components on one side bar. We designed at least 5 versions of navigation bars and conducted mini usability tests to find out which one is the most intuitive. I realized that users’ conceptual models on navigation are very different from mine since many users favored the version that I didn’t think would work at first.</p>

At the last step of signing up, they have the freedom to choose to either complete their profiles or skip this part for now. If they choose to skip, the system will later encourage them to complete profiles when they apply for project positions. The profile page also shows their level of completion to increase their motivation.</p>

                        <p>We reorganized the page of post details by clearly dividing project information and recruitment information into two cards. Readers can easily find all available positions under this project and their corresponding responsibilities and qualifications. In response to user needs, we also guide post creators to list out the duties of each position using bullet points rather than inputting big chunks of paragraphs that are less readable. In addition, they can add project logos and images to introduce their projects and teams better.</p>

                        <p>Project recruitment used to be considerably complex, as project leaders needed to employ different tools during the process, such as Google Form, Facebook, and Excel. We created a function for project leaders to manage applicants on one page. They can see all applicants’ information on this page from the applicant list. They can modify their application status and contact them via email. Click on a title in the first row, and the system will reorder the list based on that title.</p>

                        <p>My main takeaway from this project is the strategy of efficiently collaborating with computer engineers during product development. I used to deliver my design to front-end developers only until I finished a complete cycle of user interviews, usability tests, and prototypes. In this way, the team did not use time wisely, and developers quickly lost patience while waiting for my design. In contrast, developing LaunchIt was considerably efficient, as we streamlined the process through frequent and concise communication between designers and developers. One of the crucial things I did every week was working with the PM to create a task priority list for product development. The list vastly enhanced collaboration efficiency between the design and developing team by coordinating the two teams' schedules.</p>

                                    <p>As a complex and incurable disease, chronic pain is the leading contributor to sick leaves at the workplace. How might we help U.S. workers who have chronic pain complete their care routine? My team worked with Sean Ferry, our sponsor at Johnson & Johnson to tackle this problem in 15 weeks. We designed Toogether, <b id="toogether-highlight">a mobile app for companies to motivate their employees to manage chronic pain</b>, by building supportive communities and turning care routines into fun daily activities.</p>

                        <p>“How might we enable those that manage chronic pain to increase compliance in their care routine?” We received this challenge from our sponsor. The challenge statement was broad, as chronic pain impacted a wide range of demographics. We hoped to narrow down the scope. Through desk research, we gained a deeper understanding of scientific facts about chronic pain and found that chronic pain associated with work caused severe issues and was put in the spotlight these years.</p>

                        <p>The first diagram shows the current user behavior. Users normally don't take their chronic pain seriously until the pain gets unbearable. Then, they become aware of the importance of daily exercise and healthy working and living habits, but their motivation goes up and down, which keeps them from sticking to the care routine. When their pain gets better, the motivation goes all the way down, and they abandon the healthy routine.</p>
                        <p>How do we change user behavior? There are two factors of behavior change, motivation and feasibility. Higher motivation and higher feasibility lead to the success of behavior change. <b id="toogether-highlight">We aim to help users maintain high motivation through social and financial incentives and lower the activation threshold by increasing the feasibility of care routines.</b> </p>

                        <p>If the product were to be launched, we hoped to measure the success based on the participation rate, challenge completion rate, reduction in sick leave, and net promotor score. Those factors would be the direct indicators of how well our product achieved user and business goals.</p>

                        <p>Our target clients are large-size U.S. companies (500+ employees). At the stealth stage, we will develop our MVP and start from 5,000 employees of Johnson & Johnson in six months. Leveraging a successful track record with Johnson & Johnson, we believe we will be able to grow our business exponentially.  In order to achieve the growth, we need a total investment of $3M, starting from $330K in the stealth stage.</p>

                        <p>The design process was a learning process. From knowing nothing about chronic pain to becoming more knowledgeable than the average, I constantly learned from online resources, people who manage chronic pain, and experts of wellness programs. </p>
                        <p>"Don't fall in love with your first design." I heard this advice many times, but putting it into action was harder than I thought. We had disagreements sometimes when deciding on design solutions. It was hard to abandon our own ideas. Eventually, we settled our arguments by testing concepts with users and researching. It was vital to stay objective and design with users instead of letting self-consciousness drive the design process. </p>

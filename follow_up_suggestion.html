                        <p>In 2023, Chegg undertook a year-long transformation of its core Q&A platform, integrating generative AI to stay competitive. The overhaul turned the product into an AI-powered chat experience designed to deliver faster solutions than human experts and increase engagement through personalized, context-aware study help. By allowing users to ask follow-up questions after receiving homework solutions, it had great potential to enhance user engagement and retention.</p>

                        <h2 id="subtitle2">Steering my team through unexpected timeline shifts</h2>
                        <p>After getting aligned on the high-level goals and strategies, I dove into brainstorming and sketched out some early design ideas. To help the team prioritize, I grouped the concepts into three buckets:</p>
                        
                        <p><b id="highlight">Concept I: Suggestions based on problem types</b></p>
                        <p>Using learning science, problems can be broken into types like Factual, Conceptual, or Procedural. We could suggest follow-up questions tailored to each type to help deepen understanding.</p>
                        <img src="image/follow_up_type_1.jpg" alt="type 1 sketch" width="100%" style="border-radius: 28px;">
                        
                        <p><b id="highlight">Concept II: Suggestions based on problem and solution content</b></p>
                        <p>We could use the LLM to generate suggestions dynamically based on the specific content of each problem and solution. While this approach required more effort to train the LLM, it would produce more personalized and relevant suggestions.</p>
                        <img src="image/follow_up_type_2.jpg" alt="type 2 sketch" width="100%" style="border-radius: 28px;">

                        <p><b id="highlight">Concept III: Suggestions based on key terms</b></p>
                        <p>We could highlight key terms from the solution, chosen by the LLM with some guidance from learning science, and prompt users to learn more.</p>
                        <img src="image/follow_up_type_3.jpg" alt="type 3 sketch" width="100%" style="border-radius: 28px;">

                        <p><b id="highlight">Mapping out the tradeoffs to help my team prioritize and pivot</b></p>
                        <p>To help my team understand the tradeoffs, I created a 2x2 matrix to map the concepts based on effort and potential impact. With a tight timeline, we initially prioritized Concept I - Suggestions based on problem types - as it was the quickest to implement while still providing some context-aware suggestions. Midway, a company strategy shift put the project on hold, and when we picked it back up, we had more time available. <b>The 2x2 matrix I created became a key tool in guiding the team’s pivot to Concept II</b> - Suggestions based on problem and solution content - which required more effort in LLM training but promised greater impact.</p>

                        <h2 id="subtitle2">Revisiting the information hierarchy: a step back for better UX</h2>
                        <p><b id="highlight">Where should we place the new feature on an already crowded page?</b></p>
                        <p>Over the past few months, new features and content had been added to the page without much thought given to the overall information hierarchy. Now, we faced the challenge of introducing yet another feature—one that certainly wouldn’t be the last. Balancing these additions without overwhelming the interface required careful organization to maintain a clear and intuitive user experience.</p>
                        <img id="image_w_annotation" src="image/follow_up_previous_IA.jpg" alt="previous page layout" width="100%" style="border-radius: 28px;">
                        <p id="annotation">The page was based on a disorganized information hierarchy, with functions scattered throughout the interface.</p>
                        <p>Initially, PMs argued that follow-up suggestions should take priority, while actions like reviewing similar solutions or sending questions to experts were considered lower priority. However, user feedback revealed that these so-called “secondary” actions were actually quite important. Realizing we lacked a clear understanding of how users were interacting with the page, I proposed and conducted a user research study to answer critical questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Since Chegg’s solutions aren’t always 100% accurate or perfectly matched to users’ questions, how do users evaluate solutions to find the most relevant ones?</li>
                            <li>What would they do if they are still confused after finding the best solutions available? would they consider asking follow-up questions to AI?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br>
                        <p><b id="highlight">Discovering users’ mental modal through UX research</b></p>
                        <p>Using UserTesting.com, I presented the current design and observed how students identified the best solutions. Key findings included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When dissatisfied with the initial solutions, 75% of students compare similar Q&As, and if that doesn’t work, 42% turn to expert help.</li>
                            <li>Students would ask follow-up questions for clarification after identifying solutions, appreciating the immediacy of AI responses.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p><b id="highlight">A/B testing different placements</b></p>
                        <p>Based on these insights, I worked with the content designer to revamp the information hierarchy. Our changes can be summarized in two key points:</p>
                        <div class="container-fliud horizontal-card-container">
                            <div class="row gap-4">

                                        <p class="card-title"><b>Helping users find the best solution first</b></p>
                                        <p>We prioritized features that helped users find the best solution, such as simplifying Q&A comparisons and providing quick access to expert help. Once this primary goal was met, users were more likely to ask follow-up questions.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="col">

                                        <p class="card-title"><b>Surfacing follow-up suggestions at the right moment</b></p>
                                        <p> We positioned follow-up suggestions after these primary features. While the placement seemed less prominent, it ensured the feature appeared exactly when users needed it most.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>To ensure we weren’t missing an opportunity for better discoverability, my PM and I decided to play it safe by testing multiple variants. Ultimately, we included a second variant in the A/B test, placing the follow-up suggestions as a sticky element on the right rail for improved visibility. This approach allowed us to balance user needs with business goals, ensuring the new feature was both intuitive and impactful.</p>

                        <p><b id="highlight">Prompt engineering</b></p>
                        <p>I worked closely with the learning science team and LLM engineers to refine the prompt. Initially, we experimented with offering a set of predefined options (e.g., help me memorize, create an analogy, give an example) and allowed the LLM to choose the most appropriate one based on the given question. However, after conducting prompt engineering tests, we discovered that the more specific the instructions, the less relevant and lower quality the output became, as the LLM would attempt to follow the instructions too rigidly. As a result, we shifted to providing a more generic prompt, as follows:</p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; padding: 24px; font-size: 16px; background-color: #F5F5F7; border-radius: 28px;">Your goal is to provide suggestions of follow-up questions that a student might ask regarding a question and response you are helping them with original question and response context.<br><br>Write 3 follow-up questions, no longer than one sentence, tailored and relevant to the original question the student asked and the content of the answer they received. These follow-up questions should be from the perspective of a student, should be engaging and inviting for a student to ask, and span a variety of types of follow-up questions. </p>
                        <p>I estimated the typical length of follow-up questions generated by the LLM and set a character limit to ensure the output wouldn’t overwhelm the user or constrain the quality of the suggestions. The limit was added to the prompt as follows: </p>
                        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; padding: 24px; font-size: 16px; background-color: #F5F5F7; border-radius: 28px;">Each follow-up question should be brief and no longer than 120 characters. </p>

                        <p>As we integrated generative AI into the product, we realized that we had less control over the output. I became more aware of potential friction and proactively designed for possible scenarios, such as: What if it takes too long to generate follow-up suggestions? What if an error occurs and the generation fails? I made sure to address these cases within the design to ensure a smooth user experience.</p>

                        <p>In variant A, the follow-up suggestions are placed inline at the bottom of the solutions. While this placement might appear less discoverable, it aligns closely with the user’s mental model—they typically consider asking a follow-up only after identifying the right question and solution to their homework problem. This alignment proved crucial, as this variant outperformed the other variant in the A/B test.</p>

                        <p>Variant B features a more prominent placement, designed to ensure the new feature is highly visible and not easily overlooked by users. As users scroll through the screen, the follow-up suggestions remain visible, sticking to the right side of the solution as long as the solution body is in view. While this approach yielded positive results in the A/B testing, its performance was slightly lower compared to the other variant.</p>

                        <p>This project enhanced my business acumen and refined my A/B testing skills. While I previously focused primarily on advocating for user needs in my designs, this experience allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the business goals and potential impacts behind the task. I incorporated these insights into my design decisions and proactively collaborated with PMs to define success metrics and create an instrumentation plan. By designing two A/B test variants, I successfully aligned design decisions with both user needs and business objectives.</p>
